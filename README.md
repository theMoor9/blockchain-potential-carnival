# Welcome to Kenneth's Blockchain CheatRepo!

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of knowledge for learning blockchain through easy-to-reference cheat sheets. 
It is designed to help Rust users approach blockchain technology through an implementation of knowledge in Rust code. 

However, don't worry! Everyone can understand the cheat sheets; just skip the code blocks if you're not a developer, as they might be confusing.

Built as I learn, my methodical approach to learning has proven to be practically successful. I hope it will be for you too!

## Learning Philosophy

I believe that humans can explain things better than an AI can. Why? Because unlike AI, an intelligent human knows what it means not to know something and understands what is needed for a better learning process. This is why knowing how to make a query to an AI is essential and why it is not an immediate task. This is where my cheat sheets come into play. Use AI for further insights.

## Cheat Sheet

You can find a detailed Rust cheat sheet [here](./cheat_sheets).

## Documentation

I'm learning Blockchain Business model with the lectures of mr. Campbell R. Harvey at Duke's Fuqua School of Business course.
As i learn i build the cheatsheets and code what i got to seer the knowledge

## Code

You can find examples in the Rust programming language that provide an overview of blockchain protocols here.
