# Welcome to the Blockchain CheatRepo!

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of knowledge for learning blockchain through easy-to-reference cheat sheets. 
It is designed to help users approach blockchain technology. 

My methodical approach to learning has proven to be practically successful. I hope it will be for you too!

PDF versions of the .md docs are available in multiple languages - The documents have been translated using artificial intelligence without any human revisions for IT DE FR languages.

## Learning Philosophy

I believe that humans can explain things better than an AI can. Why? Because unlike AI, an intelligent human knows what it means not to know something and understands what is needed for a better learning process. This is why knowing how to make a query to an AI is essential and why it is not an immediate task. This is where my cheat sheets come into play. Use AI for further insights.
