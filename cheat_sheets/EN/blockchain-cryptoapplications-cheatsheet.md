## **§ Money and Crypto**
	
### Money
	
**Purposes of Money**:
- Unit of account comparing value to goods and services.
- Medium of exchange as a much efficient alternative of barter.
- Store of value to be retained in time partially instead of complete decay like food.
- Easy transfer of value.
	
> The easy transfer of value is the foundational idea behind Bitcoin.
	
### Acquiring Cryptocurrency
	
- **Mining**: Participate in the network to validate transactions and mine new blocks.
- **Gifts or Payment**: Receive cryptocurrency as a form of payment or as a gift.
- **Exchanges and Modern Wallets**: Purchase cryptocurrencies using platforms that function similarly to stock brokers.
- [**Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)**](#-Initial-Coin-Offerings-ICOs-1): Invest in a new cryptocurrency project by participating in its initial offering.
	
### Crypto Exchanges
	
Unlike traditional stock exchanges, crypto exchanges often adhere to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) policies due to the regulatory requirements associated with blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
	
It's important to note that these exchanges are not devoid of risks. Challenges include [frauds](#-Fraudulent-Crypto-1), hacks, and subpar business practices. Careful consideration is required when choosing an exchange to ensure security and reliability.
