## **§ Law**
	
***Premise***: Analogous entities are found worldwide, varying based on jurisdiction.
	
### SEC ( Security and Exchange Commission )
Is the commission who regulates investments for the US by informing, guiding and enforcing civil penalties.
	
- #### Applications
	When is a digital asset a "security"
	1. When a token is representing a fraction of a security like shares or directly be linked to shares or an asset figuring bonds or stocks
	2. An investment contract
	
- #### Define security
	**Howey Test**: It is a scheme whereby a person invests money in a common enterprise and expects profits solely from the efforts of the enterprise, the promoter, or any third party.
		
> **Clarification**: it is not universally clear that Bitcoin is a security; rather, it is typically classified by the SEC as not a security due to its decentralized nature.
	
- #### US Security Laws
	The SEC focuses upon manner of sale promotional material or the use case like utility or speculation purpose.
		
	- Goal to protect the "retail investors"
	- Howey only matters if token is not obviously a security such as equity or debt
	
- #### Registration and Exemption
	If the security is offered or sold to US persons the issuer must:
	1. Register the security to the SEC undergoing expensive costs that most startups can't afford.
	2. Find Registration Exemptions:
		- Regulation D - Target private and mature investment ecosystems.
		- Regulation S - Offer to non-US persons.
	
#### The Forced Medal
At the end there's only to realities to deal with the law:
	
- The LOW Cost of engaging a lawyer to determine if it is a case of a security.
- The HIGH cost of not engaging a lawyer to determine if it is a case of a security.
	
### CFTC ( Commodity Futures Trading Commission )
Is the commission who aims to protect market participants consumers and public from fraud manipulation and abuse practices.
	
- #### Applications 
	A commodity is a raw material or an agricultural product (Except onions...), service, right and interest that can be bought and sold, whose value is based on a standard market and which is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. 
	
- #### Securities are not Commodities
	Digital assets which do not fall under the category of Security are Commodities.
	
- #### CFTC and Commodities Law 
	Cryptocurrencies are practically under the scope of CFTC
	
	- Action is taken against unregistered crypto-exchanges
	- Guidance about what is spot or derivatives
	- Volatilities warnings are issued
	- Addressing ponzi schemes
	- Cracking down market price manipulators
	
### FinCEN ( Financial Crimes Enforcement Network )

- KYC ( Know Your Customer ) Laws - Verify and maintain the identities of costumers.
	
### IRS ( Internal Revenue Service )

- Short term (Held less than a year)
- Long  term (Held longer than a year)
	
Crypto is taxed also when used as a medium of exchange for good and services which could be a complicated matter due to the volatility
	
#### Issues
	
1. What if a Cryptocurrency is acquired at different times so at different values?
2. Is a token associated to an ICO a security or a property?
3. How do we handle forks? As dividend or as a capital gain?
4. How do we handle airdrops giveaways? Is that income?
	
### Others US Regulators
	
- Department of Justice
- FBI
- CIA
- FTC
- State Laws
	
### Challenges
	
- This technology is novel and often challenges the boundaries of existing regulations.
- Often, technology advances faster than regulatory frameworks can adapt.
- It is difficult for regulators and their legal advisors to stay current with technological developments.
- Nonetheless, it is advisable to consult with regulatory authorities before taking significant actions.
