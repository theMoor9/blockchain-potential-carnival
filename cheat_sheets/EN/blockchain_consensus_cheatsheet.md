## ยง Overview
	
### Consensus 
**Definition**: Consensus in blockchain refers to the mechanism through which nodes (independent computers connected in a network) agree on the state of a distributed ledger. It ensures that all transactions are valid and irreversible, according to rules defined by the consensus algorithm.
	
**Types**
- Majority = 51%
- Super-Majority = +66%
- Unanimous = 100%
- Weighted = Proof of Stake Votes are weighted based on the stake (or the amount of cryptocurrency held) by each node.
	
### Nodes
	
**Definition**: A node is a computer that runs software supporting a specific blockchain architecture, forming a part of the blockchain's distributed network.
	
##### Common nodes
	
**Mining Node**: Highly specialized and powerful computers that perform computations to propose new blocks. They receive mining rewards, covering the cost of their operations.
	
**Full Node**: Acts as a relay between the creation of blocks and their distribution. They maintain a complete copy of the blockchain's ledger and validate all transactions and blocks to ensure consistency and security.
	
**Light Node**: Acts as a relay between the creation of blocks and their distribution. They maintain a complete copy of the blockchain's ledger and validate all transactions and blocks to ensure consistency and security.
	
### Needs
	
In a blockchain system, which is distributed and decentralized, a robust mechanism is essential since parties involved often cannot inherently trust each other. We need to ensure the integrity of the ledger so that the transaction history is reliable. This leads to the necessity of validating transactions without needing trust.
	
The consensus mechanism and its forms are designed to address these issues.
	
> **Consensus** is the process that allows trust in the outcome of a transaction or a block within a blockchain, without needing to trust the individual parties involved in the transaction or the entity that verifies it.
