## Blockchain: A Peer-to-Peer Distributed Database

- **Definition**: Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed database technology where every machine (peer) acts as a node-block.
- **Mechanism**: Each block is linked to the next through a cryptographic hash.
- **Code implementation of the knowledge**:

```Rust
```

## Trust and Immutability

- **No Trust Needed**: Features of the blocks and ownership are registered in the immutable history of the chain (ledgers).
- **Consensus Control**: Consensus is always controlled by every block in the chain through Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.
- **Code implementation of the knowledge**:

```Rust
```
## Security and Efficiency

- **Ownership Verification**: This solves ownership verification and exchange in a secure way without a middle person.
- **Speed**: Data transfer times are significantly faster, almost instantaneous, which is useful for market exchanges and property-related transfers.
- **Core Features**: Security, speed, and ownership verification are the main features that make blockchain crucial for economic services.
- **Code implementation of the knowledge**:

```Rust
```
## Anti-Counterfeiting

- **Ledger Verification**: Blockchain solves counterfeiting by checking the ledgers of the blockchains.
- **Code implementation of the knowledge**:

```Rust
```
## Disruptive Potential

- **Applications**: The practical applications of blockchains are many: voting by unique tokens, IoT security, medical ecosystem enhancements, financial statements, secure process validations, transaction transparency for governance, passports, and more.
- **Code implementation of the knowledge**:

```Rust
```
