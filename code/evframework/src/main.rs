ICO Evaluation Framework: Macro Areas and Questions Overview

1. Idea:
   - Evaluates the novelty, necessity, and economic impact of the ICO's core concept.
   - Questions include:
     * What problem is the ICO trying to solve? Is it significant and meaningful?
     * Does the market already exist for this product, or does it need to be created?
     * Is the problem being addressed something that is currently handled by a layer of unnecessary complexity or middlemen?
     * What unique solution does the ICO propose? Is this solution a significant improvement on existing alternatives?
     * Is the idea scalable and capable of achieving wide adoption?

2. Technology:
   - Assesses the technical feasibility, innovation, and scalability of the technology used.
   - Questions include:
     * Is the technological solution proposed by the ICO feasible and currently available?
     * Does the ICO's technology offer a substantial improvement over existing technology?
     * How does the ICO handle data security and privacy concerns?
     * Is the underlying technology behind the ICO robust and scalable?
     * What are the potential technical challenges the ICO might face, and how does it plan to address them?

3. Blockchain Specifics:
   - Examines the choice of blockchain, token economics, and alignment with project needs.
   - Questions include:
     * What blockchain platform is being used, and why was it chosen?
     * Is there a genuine need for blockchain technology in this ICO, or could the problem be solved using traditional technology?
     * Does the ICO introduce a new token, and what is its utility within the ecosystem?
     * How does the tokenomics structure impact the potential for long-term sustainability?
     * Are there any innovative blockchain features, such as smart contracts or decentralized applications, being utilized?

4. Team:
   - Reviews the experience, expertise, and reliability of the team behind the ICO.
   - Questions include:
     * What are the backgrounds and previous experiences of the team members?
     * Does the team have a proven track record in similar ventures or in the blockchain industry?
     * How is the team's expertise relevant to the success of the project?
     * Are there any advisors, and what roles do they play in the project?
     * How does the team plan to grow, and what strategies are in place for scaling up?

5. Execution:
   - Considers the operational strategy, legal compliance, and financial planning of the ICO.
   - Questions include:
     * What is the roadmap for the ICO, and what milestones have already been achieved?
     * How does the ICO plan to use the funds raised?
     * Are there clear marketing and outreach strategies in place?
     * How does the ICO plan to handle regulatory and legal issues?
     * What are the risks associated with the ICO, and how does it plan to mitigate them?

6. Market Potential:
   - Analyzes the market demand, competition, and growth potential of the ICO.
   - Questions include:
     * Is the idea scalable? What is a realistic share of the market?
     * Is there positive convexity to apply a similar idea in related applications?
